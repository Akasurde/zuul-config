    name: ansible-buildset-registry
    description: |
      Starts a buildset registry which interacts with the intermediate
      CI registry to share speculative container images between
      projects.

      Configure any jobs which require the use of a buildset registry
      to depend on this job using the "dependencies" job attribute.

      This job will pause after starting the registry so that it is
      available to any jobs which depend on it.  Once all such jobs
      are complete, this job will finish.

      Pull from the intermediate registry

      This is a parent for jobs which use container images and expect
      a buildset registry to be running.  It pulls images from the
      intermediate registry into it.
